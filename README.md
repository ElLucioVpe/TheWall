# TheWall <small>(by luciusâœ¨ðŸ’žðŸŒ·)</small>

## Introduction

Simple website for writing whatever you want publicly on a website everyone can see. Original idea by [elcomix97edu](https://github.com/elcomix97edu/thewall).

It was written mainly in good ol' PHP but I'm currently porting it over to Go, so I made a new branch for that you can check here.

## Notes
   
  * Importing the database
  
  TheWall currently runs on MySQL. Inside the "db" folder there's everything you need to set it up or modify it.
