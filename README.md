# TheWall <small>(by lucius✨💞🌷)</small>

## Introduction

Simple website for writing whatever you want publicly on a website everyone can see. Original idea by [elcomix97edu](https://github.com/elcomix97edu/thewall).

Written mainly in cool, flaming, shade-glasses looking [GO](https://golang.org/).


## Notes
   
  * Importing the database
  
  TheWall currently runs on MySQL. Inside the "db" folder there's everything you need to set it up or modify it.
