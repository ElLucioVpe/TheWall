# TheWall <small>(by lucius‚ú®üíûüå∑)</small>

## Introduction

Simple website for writing whatever you want publicly on a website everyone can see. Original idea by [elcomix97edu](https://github.com/elcomix97edu/thewall).

Written mainly in cool, flaming, shade-glasses looking [GO](https://golang.org/).


## Notes
   
  * Importing the database
  
  TheWall currently runs on MySQL. Inside the "db" folder there's everything you need to set it up or modify it.
  
  * Connecting GO to MySQL
  
  Here's a template for the 'conectarDB' package:
  
  ~~~~
  package conectarDB

import (
   "database/sql"
)

func Conectar() (*sql.DB, error) {
		// Abrimos conexion a MySQL
		db, err := sql.Open("mysql", "user:pass@tcp(localhost:3306)/theWall")

		// In case there's some error
		if err != nil {
			panic(err.Error())
		}
		
		return db, err;
}
 ~~~~
